## Introduction

These are my personal dotfiles for an Arch Linux laptop running Wayland.

This setup is the environment I use every day for programming, writing, and general work. It is built around Hyprland with a keyboard-driven workflow, quiet Catppuccin Mocha colors, and practical system controls that stay out of the way. Rather than setting up complex animations or excessive desktop widgets, the focus is on fast window management, good contrast, and hardware controls that work predictably.

## Screenshot

The visual arrangement is kept clean and lightweight: a discreet status bar with essential system meters, tiled windows with gentle rounded corners and subtle border gradients, and translucent terminal windows that remain easy to read across different wallpapers.

## How I Organised It

The repository keeps configurations separated by application rather than bundled into large monolithic files:

```text
dotfiles/
├── hypr/        # Hyprland Lua modules, hyprlock, hypridle, hyprpaper, scripts
├── ags/         # Aylur's GTK Shell widgets (media player and telemetry)
├── rofi/        # Launchers and custom applets (battery, wifi, bluetooth, power)
├── swaync/      # Notification center styling and widgets
├── wlogout/     # Session menu layout and local icons
├── kitty/       # Primary terminal configuration
├── alacritty/   # Alternative terminal configuration
├── yazi/        # Terminal file manager configuration and plugins
├── btop/        # Terminal resource monitor theme
├── fastfetch/   # System fetch branding and ASCII logos
└── .bashrc      # Fallback Bash configuration
```

Hyprland itself uses native Lua configuration (Hyprland 0.55+). The entry point `hypr/hyprland.lua` loads dedicated modules for each concern—monitors, input, appearance, animations, keybindings, window rules, and startup commands—so changing one aspect of the setup does not require touching anything else.

## Notes & Compatibility

* **Target platform**: Arch Linux
* **Session**: Pure Wayland (X11 is not supported)
* **Compositor**: Hyprland (version 0.55 or newer is required for native Lua configuration support)
* **Hardware profile**: Configured for an x86_64 laptop. Touchpad gestures, battery monitors, and brightness controls rely on standard Linux kernel interfaces (`/sys/class/power_supply`, `/sys/class/backlight`)
* **Personal setup**: These files reflect my personal hardware and preferences. If you choose to use them, review the files first and adapt paths and monitor settings to match your own machine

## License

This repository does not specify an overarching open-source license for the personal configuration collection. Third-party themes, assets, and plugins included in this repository (such as Alacritty themes and Yazi plugins) remain subject to their respective upstream licenses.
