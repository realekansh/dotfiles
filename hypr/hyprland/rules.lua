-- Window and workspace rules.

-- Phase 1 establishes the rule *architecture* rather than accumulating
-- application-specific rules. Only rules with a concrete, general purpose
-- are included. App-specific float/pin/workspace assignments belong in later
-- phases where each rule can be justified by an observed behavior.

-- Many apps (browsers in particular) emit bogus maximize requests on startup.
-- Suppressing them prevents Hyprland from blowing tiled windows up to
-- fullscreen unexpectedly. The handle is kept local so individual rules could
-- be toggled later, e.g. `suppressMaximizeRule:set_enabled(false)`.
